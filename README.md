# Breast-cancer-prediction
this was our project in college 
the dataset was almost clean(from gfg)
we uses knn for identifying 2 differnt type sof tumor 
main my contriution was to use Data science for to find not only the top releted feature to the respectove result but also to compare 2 different feature also this way we got to know about many features that were casuing "OVERFITTING".
NOTE->but the main fact is that it was one of the best possible datasets on breast canser on kaggle it can many columns compare to rows that we had hence resulting in more accuracy.
